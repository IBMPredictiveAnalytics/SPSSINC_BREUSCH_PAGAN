# SPSSINC BREUSCH PAGAN
## Estimate a linear model and perform a heteroscedasticity test.
 This procedure estimates a linear model and performs the Breusch-Pagan heteroscedasticity test, using the ncv.test function from the R car package. The null hypothesis is constant error variance. You can specify whether the alternative is that the variance is a function of the dependent variable or a function of a specified set of predictors. The procedure allows you to save both the residuals from the regression and the estimated coefficients.
