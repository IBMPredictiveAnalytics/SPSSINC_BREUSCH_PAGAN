# SPSSINC BREUSCH PAGAN
## Estimate a linear model and perform a heteroscedasticity test.
 This procedure estimates a linear model and performs the   Breusch-Pagan heteroscedasticity test, using the ncv.test function fr  om the R car package. The null hypothesis is constant error variance.   You can specify whether the alternative is that the variance is a fu  nction of the dependent variable or a function of a specified set of   predictors. The procedure allows you to save both the residuals from   the regression and the estimated coefficients.  x/
